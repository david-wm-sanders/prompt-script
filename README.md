# prompt-script
LaTEX template for a prompt script for a character in a pantomime or other production.

This template was derived from a LaTEX document I created for my part in Crickhowell's 2016 performance of the pantomime "Trouble in Pantoland" *(by Sharon Hulm)*.

The primary content of the template is the package requirements/setup and the definition of the **sceneflow** environment and the commands: **\scenetitle**, **\note**, **\song**, **\voc** and **\act**. These layout the script and highlight the performer's lines/actions.

The remainder of the template is example content that shows how to use the custom environment and commands to create a prompt script. Example output of running **pdflatex pantomime.tex** can be found in [pantomime.pdf](https://github.com/david-wm-sanders/prompt-script/blob/master/pantomime.pdf)
